     2. Primary Health Centre (PHC) : <br>

		PHC is the first contact point between village community and the medical officer.

The PHCs were envisaged to provide an integrated curative and preventive health care to the rural population with emphasis on preventive and promotive aspects of health care. The PHCs are established and maintained by the State governments under the Minimum Needs Programme (MNP)/ Basic Minimum Services (BMS) Programme.

As per minimum requirement, a PHC is to be manned by a medical officer supported by 14 paramedical and other staff. Under NRHM, there is a provision for two additional staff nurses at PHCs on contract basis. It acts as a referral unit for 6 Sub Centres and has 4-6 beds for patients. The activities of PHC involve curative, preventive, promotive and family welfare services.

At the national level, there are 24855 PHCs functioning (i.e 16613 PHCs and 8242 HWC-PHCs) in rural areas as on 31st March 2019. There is an upgradation of 8242 of PHCs as HWC-PHCs. The significant number of conversion of PHCs into HWC-PHCs have been observed in the States of Andhra Pradesh (1145), Uttar Pradesh (946), Odisha (827), Gujarat (772), Tamil Nadu (716) and Telangana (636). Significant increases in the number of PHCs have been seen in the States of Karnataka (446), Gujarat (406), Rajasthan (369), Assam (336), Jammu & Kashmir (288) and Chhattisgarh (275).
